    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>Lightelligence</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed GNU and LLVM toolchains and integrated QEMU on RISC-V for our NPU co-processor.</li>
        <li>Evaluated open-source frameworks like TVM and SYCL/OpenCL for NPU integration.</li>
        <li>Assessed software and hardware solutions from vendors for optical computing in AI and data science applications.</li>
        <li>Negotiated with RISC-V vendors leveraging the GNU/LLVM toolchains I developed.</li>
        <li>Led software development for the Aurora hardware product, including compiler backend development.</li>
        <li>Implemented built-in functions and code generation for our ISA in Clang and LLVM; provided guidance to other engineers.</li>
        <li>Developed TaskGraph to integrate with TVM and Runtime, enabling deep learning graph support on our platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Biren</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed GPU code generation for tensor instructions and handled usharpid processing.</li>
        <li>Optimized GPU compiler performance and resolved bugs.</li>
        <li>Authored a white paper proposing solutions for parallel processing in our CUDA-like language's async{...} construct.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Kneron</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Redesigned the top layers of our NPU compiler to support a common graph data structure compatible with ONNX.</li>
        <li>Implemented compiler input interfaces to support encrypted ONNX models and specific configuration file formats.</li>
        <li>Explored and confirmed solutions for MLIR support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hisilicon</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Contributed to the development of a new GPU for mobile devices, transitioning from ARM architecture.</li>
        <li>Independently implemented approximately 80% of texture-related APIs in the compiler (frontend and LLVM backend) and authored corresponding documentation.</li>
        <li>Assisted and mentored other engineers on the remaining 20% of texture-related APIs; collaborated with the texture architecture lead.</li>
        <li>Developed Prefetch-Sample optimization to allow drivers to execute 2D-sampling instructions before loading/running GLSL shaders.</li>
        <li>Implemented compiler support for our GPU's load/store operations for RGBA fixed-point formats in Vulkan (32, 16, 11, 10, and 2 bits; including NaN and Infinity) and authored related documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Marvell</h3>
